# Development

After writing your documentation, you can start implementation.

## Listing the dependency

Before implementation, it is always good to list out what dependency you will use.

You may ask:

- Does this new feature relate to any existing `Controller`, `Service` or `Repository`?
- Any new third-party library you will use?
- Any sharable logic (e.g. Rate Limiting, Localization)?

### Adding `Service`

### Adding `Repository`

## Working with third-party library

## Pattern to avoid
